# Functional Yahztee in RUBY
This is a stab at the rubyquiz #19 problem and solution. I find the solution offered to be a highly coupled ugly mess of shit. And yes, I think I can do better, or I wouldn't be writing a yahtzee game.

## Usage
No idea yet. I want it decoupled from any UI. It should be able to be plugged into a web or console UI easily. I don't 'do' top down.

I like getting the functional internals squared away first. I can identify internals pretty easily based on many, many years of writing shit.

As I build my internals (functional and idempotent) I move closer to my domain and the dsl starts to present itself.

In OO I go top down, in functional I go bottom up.

Writing short, functional, idempotent (READ AWESOME) methods to lead the design is better than letting the 'real' world lead the design. This is my experience anyway - your milage may vary. 

Controversial, eat me. My code is prettier than your code.

## Health
Our goverment can't get this shit right, but I can...
