# Functional Yahztee in RUBY
This is a stab at the rubyquiz #19 problem and solution. I find the solution offered to be a highly coupled ugly mess of shit. And yes, I think I can do better, or I wouldn't be writing a yahtzee game.

## Usage
No idea yet. I want it decoupled from any UI shit. It should be able to be plugged into a web or console UI easily.
